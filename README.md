# For My Forever, Mawar 🌹 - Deployment & Customization

## Quick Start
1.  **Open**: Double-click `index.html` to view the website.
2.  **Music**: The music button won't play until you put an mp3 file in `assets/soft-loop.mp3` or interact with the page first (browser policy).

## How to Customize
I have included some AI-generated romantic art in the `assets` folder for you. To make this truly special:

1.  **Your Photos**:
    *   Find your 3 favorite photos.
    *   Rename them to `photo1.png`, `photo2.png`, and `photo3.png`.
    *   Replace the files in the `assets/` folder.
    *   (If you use .jpg files, you can simply rename the extension or edit line 262 in `index.html`).

2.  **Your Music**:
    *   Find a romantic song (MP3 format).
    *   Rename it to `soft-loop.mp3`.
    *   Put it in the `assets/` folder.

## Hidden Secrets (Don't tell her!)
*   **7 Clicks**: Click the heart (❤) in the "Note" section 7 times to see your secret oath.
*   **Konami Code**: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A on keyboard.
*   **Audio**: Type "pandu" quickly to play a hidden sound (you can add a `secret.mp3` and uncomment the code in `index.html` line 440 to make this work!).

Made with love! ❤️
